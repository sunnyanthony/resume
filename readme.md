## EXPERIENCES
### Senior Software Engineer
> RealTek Inc. 2020 Sep. - Present
#### NB-IOT SDK | 2020 - Present
* System Infrastructures
  1. Design an efficient tiny data system that backups and restores data in sleep management and guaranteeing data completeness.
    2. Implement a port of sleep management in RealTek's boot- loader to manage the backup-memory.
    3. Enhance FreeRTOS to support sleep mode.
* Tools
    1. Implement a hard-code tool that reads yaml configuration and generates a bin file to be the base of calibration setting.
    2. Develop a CI tool to control Jenkins with remote APIs to trigger CI procedures.
* Network Protocols and System SDK
    1. Enhance LwIP Network stack to support sleep mode to save power while no connection in.
    2. Enhance the protocol between the iperf2 of Cellular Callbox and the lightweight Iperf2.    
    3. Co-implement and applying RealTek's sleep management framework APIs.

#### NB-IOT SDK | 2018 - 2020
* System Infrastructures
    1. Ported FreeRTOS and CMSIS_OS to the OS portable layer for a new MCU/DSP.
    2. Co-designed a multi-core message-based communication framework for making tasks to transmit messages between different OSs.
    3. Implemented a new feature of RealTek's boot-loader to boot multiple OSs on each CPUs.
    4. Improved the system security by TrustZone partition.
* Tools
    1. Implemented a post-linker tool that combined a secure ELF (TrustZone) and a non-secure ELF.
    2. Designed an efficient multi-image placement algorithm that reduced flash fragmented memory in RealTek's post-linker tool.
    3. Implemented experimental MIScheduler and .td file in the LLVM to utilize more Units (not adopted).
    4. Setup Jenkins CI with Gitlab to build every commit. 
* Network Protocols and System SDK
    1. Improved Wakaama open source and re-designing its DTLS, datagram TLS, and connection layer with MbedTLS.
    2. Enhanced MbedTLS on RealTek's hardware accelerator in order to speed up the encrypt, decrypt and hash calculation.
    3. Implemented and improved network stack and tool like Ping ( ipv4 and ipv6 ), Iperf2, Cellular Interface in LwIP, ADP layer in LTE stack, UDP and IP layer in LwIP and socket APIs.
    4. Implemented a AT agent framework to control modem system and assign network information to RealTek's netwoek interface.
* Demo
    1. Modified a bootstrap dashboard website to present and query our lwm2m dynamic.
    2. Configured Nginx with fcgi to response POST request between front-end and back-end (lwm2m server).
    3. Used Postgres to store sample data from IOT device and access by lwm2m server.
#### LTE UE system | 2017 - 2018
* Linux Kernel and RTOS infrastructures
    1. Implemented remote processor message (RPMsg) virtual device that gained a memory zero-copy between two processors.
    2. Re-wrote and improved VirtIO console device.
    3. Maintained VirtIO net device.
    4. Co-worked in VirtIO, vring and rproc framework.
    5. Co-Modified QEMU to emulate our system
* Applications
    1. Implemented a log daemon of modem and get log from rproc device for log tracing.
    2. Implemented a RPmsg APIs Library for user to send messages to remote processor.
